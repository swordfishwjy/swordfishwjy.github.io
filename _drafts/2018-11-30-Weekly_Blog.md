#### MIT Technology Review Reading
1. There is a trend that asian countries adopt or plan to adopt more industrial-robots

2. Companies are trying to replace WiFi with 5G cellular networks for better latency, wider ranges, agile mobility, and flexible programmability. Harbor Research, predict that the IoT market will grow approximately 30% a year through 2028, when it will generate $356 billion.

3. A startup named Lightelligence whsoe CEO is a phd student, YichenShen, is developing a optical chip for deep learning.
一个理论：In theory, transferring information at the speed of light means such as device could let AI algorithms run hundreds of times faster than today's best AI chips.

4. In the north of America, people say "you guys"; in the south, say "y'all". This kind of
linguistic difference may be explained by self-organization in physics.
